Welcome to my corner of the Internet!  My name is Jules, and I'm a tinkerer.  From the age that I could first hold a screwdriver, I've been taking things apart--always curious to find out the way stuff works.

I was originally drawn to physics out of a similar interest in understanding the way nature works.  While studying at UT Austin, I came to love experimental atomic physics.  In the lab, there were many new tools to learn and an endless supply of things to mend and improve.  It's really an ideal environment for a maker!

I followed the thread into graduate school at MIT where I earned a PhD in atomic physics working with trapped ions to do research in quantum computing.  At MIT, I was afforded many opportunities to pick up new skills and to help others follow the "way" of experimentation.  Truthfully, I feel as though the most important thing I learned in grad school was how to learn efficiently.

Going forward, I intend to continue making new things; documenting and teaching the process when I know it; hacking and tinkering when I don't.  Ultimately, I think, anything is possible: you just have to know the steps. ðŸ›¸
