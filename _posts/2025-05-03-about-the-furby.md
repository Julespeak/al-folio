I never had an original Furby when I was a kid.  But, boy, do I remember them.  Who doesn't?

In retrospect, I have always been intrigued by the Furby.  It is a simple hardware I/O device made to behave in a cute and engaging way.  Its purpose is to be fun to play with.  Pure form over function.

It is a technologically-advanced item that doesn't actually _do_ anything.  And I think that it's a bold artistic statement.
